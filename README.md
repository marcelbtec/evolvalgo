# Evolutionary Algorithm Framework with Artistic Visualization

This project provides a simple toy framework for implementing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) with tracking and visualization capabilities. While the current implementation demonstrates the framework using a simple quadratic optimization problem, the architecture is designed to be adaptable to various optimization tasks.

## üéØ Overview

Evolutionary Algorithms are population-based optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution. This framework implements a binary-coded EA with the following key features:
- Flexible individual representation
- Configurable evolutionary operators
- Comprehensive performance tracking
- Real-time visualization
- Artistic presentation of results

### Example Problem
The current implementation demonstrates the framework by finding the maximum of:
```
f(x) = -(x-5)¬≤ + 100
```
where x is represented as an 8-bit binary number. This serves as a simple example to showcase the framework's capabilities.

## üß¨ Framework Components

### 1. Individual Representation
- Binary-coded individuals (configurable length)
- Extensible to other encoding schemes
- Customizable fitness function
- Flexible genotype-to-phenotype mapping

### 2. Evolutionary Operators
- **Selection**: Configurable tournament selection
- **Crossover**: Adjustable crossover operators
- **Mutation**: Customizable mutation rates and operators
- **Elitism**: Configurable elite preservation

### 3. Population Management
- Adjustable population size
- Configurable generation limits
- Early stopping criteria
- Diversity maintenance options

## üìä Visualization Framework

The implementation includes a flexible visualization system that can be adapted to different problem domains:

1. **Main Landscape Plot**
   - Problem-specific fitness landscape
   - Population evolution tracking
   - Solution space exploration

2. **Fitness Convergence Plot**
   - Best fitness tracking
   - Average fitness monitoring
   - Convergence analysis
   - Statistical confidence intervals

3. **Population Diversity Plot**
   - Diversity metrics
   - Convergence patterns
   - Population dynamics

4. **Solution Distribution Plot**
   - Final population analysis
   - Solution space coverage
   - Convergence verification

5. **Algorithm Statistics**
   - Performance metrics
   - Parameter settings
   - Solution quality indicators

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  ```
  matplotlib
